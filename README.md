# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data. It leverages regression algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to forecast future values of stock closing prices.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualization of trends and correlation
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error
- Predictive analysis and plotting results


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 How it Works

1. Load and explore the historical stock data.
2. Perform preprocessing and feature engineering.
3. Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression).
4. Evaluate model performance on test data.
5. Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.
